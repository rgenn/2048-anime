{"name":"2048 Anime version","tagline":"2048 gameplay but using photos","body":"Hi! Welcome to my *slightly* modified version of 2048 (made by [Gabriel Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com/)). 2048 is a totally addictive game, and although I've never reached 2048 before, it's still quite a fun game for me. I wanted to try editing the original game's code to display images instead of numbers, but this time using photos of anime characters I really like. <3\r\n\r\nI modified only a little bit of the original code, since this is my first time to work with Git, Github, and CSS. The steps on how I did it was provided by an online class in Udacity ([Make Your Own 2048](https://www.udacity.com/course/progress#!/c-ud248)). It took me a while (3-4 days) to figure out how to use Git and Github, but it turned out to be quite easy once you get the hang of it. I hope you have fun playing with this version of 2048.\r\n\r\nHow to use:\r\n* Download and unzip the file (either .zip or .tgz).\r\n* Open the folder and double-click on index.html to run the game.\r\n* Click on New Game. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to start playing. Have fun!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
